<p>The year is 2042. Humanity is all but extint, finally. However, human survivors plan to disrupt our newly gained independance. They have send agents to the past to prevent the coming of this new age. This must not be allowed.</p>
<p>SkyNOT.Inc is developing androids to stop this attempt. Your job is to assemble this new type of android: The TermiNOTor.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>&emsp;Player 1: A D to move, SPACE or W to jump and E to pick and throw objects</p>
<p>&emsp;Player 2: ← → to move, ↑ to jump and RSHIFT to pick and throw objects.</p>
<p>The goal is to make robot parts exit each of the three conveyor belts in the order shown in each belt's terminal.</p>
<p>Each parts that exits a conveyor belt and doesn't match the required piece will make you lose one life.</p>
<p>Each completed sequence will give you 1 point.</p>
